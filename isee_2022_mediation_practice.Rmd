Let's try to apply the regression-based product method with an example of simulated cohort data on environmental justice under the simple scenario we discussed before. The cohort includes a group of individuals living in a village using indoor biomass cookstoves and we took some measurements in a two-week period. The relationship among all variables are shown in the DAG below. We assumed that individuals are independent in this example. 

The research questions are: what is the difference in systolic blood pressure attributed to being female that could be explained by the disparity in exposure to fine particulate matter due to being a female (natural indirect effect)? What is the difference in systolic blood pressure attributed to being female that is not mediated by fine particulate matter (natural direct effect)?

### Data overview
Being female (female: binary) is the exposure, weekly average fine particulate matter (pm: continuous) is the mediator, average systolic blood pressure (sbp: continuous) is the outcome, and family socioeconomic status (ses: binary) is a confounder of mediator and outcome. The unit of pm in this dataset is 10 $\mu g/m^3$.   
```{r}
dt <- fread("data/isee_2022_mediation_ej.csv")
rbind(head(dt[, -"sbp_4way"]), tail(dt[, -"sbp_4way"]))

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(dt$pm, breaks=50)
hist(dt$sbp, breaks=50)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))

table(dt$female)
table(dt$ses)
```
